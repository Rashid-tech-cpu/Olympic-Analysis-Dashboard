# Olympic-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project using python and its lybraries, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
- Analyze the dataset to understand trends in medal distribution.
- Identify the top-performing countries and athletes.
- Study the gender distribution of events and medals.
- Visualize the data using Python

## DASET USED
- <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EHMliUCEb8k6VhkpxK00oaY6GQtkwrhg/view?usp=sharing">Data-Set</a>

## KPIs QUESTIONS

- Which countries have won the most total medals (Gold + Silver + Bronze)?
- Which countries have won the most Gold medals?
- What is the medal trend over time (1976â€“2008) for the top 5 countries?
- Which sports have awarded the most medals?
- Who are the top-performing athletes (by total medals)?
- Which countries perform best in each sport (e.g., swimming, athletics)?
- How many unique athletes have won medals for each country?
- What is the average number of medals won per Olympic edition per country?
- Which gender (Men/Women) contributes more to the total medal count by country?
- How many medals has the host country won in each Olympic edition?
